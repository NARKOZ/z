q: why is this written in prototype instead of jquery?
a: i prefer to use raw javascript, as well as other one off libs that dont require anything like prototype, jquery, extjs, etc.
   the reason behind this is because it helps lessen the amount of code behind very powerful framework, and i prefer prototype.

q: somethings broken
a: haha, i bet it is. yea i really dont pay much attention to what i commit so things might sneak in sometimes.
