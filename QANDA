q: why is this written in prototype instead of jquery?
a: i prefer to use raw javascript, as well as other one off libs that dont require anything like prototype, jquery, extjs, etc.
   the reason behind this is because it helps lessen the amount of code behind very powerful framework, and i prefer prototype.

q: somethings broken
a: haha, i bet it is. yea i really dont pay much attention to what i commit so things might sneak in sometimes.

q: will this run on a host such as nodester, dotcloud, etc ("they support node and npm)
a: absolutely, i have done testing on the nodester platform with z and it works just fine with all the latest stuff via npm.
   now, dotcloud (and others that "front" their node.js installations with nginx) have problems with the very latest version of
   socket.io (0.7), as well as just plain not supporting proxied websockets (nginx mangles them). the "fix" lies in setting a
   var in config.json to 0.6 instead of 0.7 (of whatevers already there) - a slightly hacked version of socket.io 0.6 is shipped
   and works only with xhr-polling, nothing more. because of the variability in how messages get handled between these two vers,
   i will not be doing bugfixes (unless its major and deals with z and not socket.io) on this fallback method, all development
   will be focused on whatever happens to be latest code available out of npm. this is why this note isnt in NOTES.
