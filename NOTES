1) install libs:

   leaf requirements (install in order!):
     sudo npm install connect
     sudo npm install connect-gzip
     sudo npm install express
     sudo npm install goo.gl
     sudo npm install jade
     sudo npm install jsonreq
     sudo npm install oauth
     sudo npm install socket.io
     sudo npm install socket.io-sessions

   optional:

     couchdb support:
       sudo npm install connect-couchdb
       set storage_type to "couch" in config.json

     mongo support:
       sudo npm install connect-mongo
       set storage_type to "mongo" in config.json

     redis support:
       sudo npm install connect-redis
       set storage_type to "redis" in config.json

   it is highly recommended that you use one of the above store methods rather than memory, as it is known to leak.

2) register your application here: https://dev.twitter.com/apps
   be sure to set the application type to "browser", use "http://127.0.0.1:8080/oauth/callback" as the callback url.
   copy the oauth key and secret into config.json (and change anything you would like in there)...
   be sure to change the storage_secret to something other than blank - it is a salt for sessions!
3) register a gmail account, and go here for a url shortener key: https://code.google.com/apis/console
4) register for a klout api key here: http://developer.klout.com/apps/mykeys
5) register for an imgur api key here: http://imgur.com/register/api_anon
6) configure config.json
