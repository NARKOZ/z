   do not, under any circumstances, do any of the following until these notices are removed:
     1) run this server in a production environment, or allow more than a single user to connect (localhost + you!)
     2) enable the sitestream code, it is untested right now and is mostly considered "scaffolding" pseudocode to doc
        what is described on the page.

1) install libs:

   leaf requirements (install in order!):
     sudo npm install connect
     sudo npm install connect-gzip
     sudo npm install express
     sudo npm install goo.gl
     sudo npm install jade
     sudo npm install jsonreq
     sudo npm install nstore
     sudo npm install oauth
     sudo npm install socket.io
     sudo npm install socket.io-sessions

2) register your application here: https://dev.twitter.com/apps
3) register a gmail account, and go here for a url shortener key: https://code.google.com/apis/console
4) register for an imgur api key here: http://imgur.com/register/api_anon
5) configure the remaineder config.json
   a few things you should know:
   on dev.twitter.com:
     set application type to "browser", and use "http://<host>:<port>/<oauth_callback>" as the callback url.
     set access to read + write + direct messages
   if you cannot directly set the host and port, leave the host as "", and the port as 0.
   be sure to change the storage_secret to something other than blank - it is a salt for sessions!
