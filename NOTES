   do not, under any circumstances, do any of the following until these notices are removed:
     1) run this server in a production environment, or allow more than a single user to connect (localhost + you!)
     2) enable the sitestream code, it is untested right now and is mostly considered "scaffolding" pseudocode to doc
        what is described on the page.

1) install libs:

   leaf requirements (install in order!):
     sudo npm install connect
     sudo npm install connect-gzip
     sudo npm install express
     sudo npm install goo.gl
     sudo npm install jade
     sudo npm install jsonreq
     sudo npm install oauth
     sudo npm install socket.io
     sudo npm install socket.io-sessions

   optional:

     couchdb support (tested, works):
       sudo npm install connect-couchdb
       set storage_type to "couch" in config.json

     mongo support (tested, works):
       sudo npm install connect-mongo
       set storage_type to "mongo" in config.json

     redis support (thoroughly tested, you should use this one):
       sudo npm install connect-redis
       set storage_type to "redis" in config.json
       redis extra support:
         since redis is very cool and fast, if you have a *nix machine, install this too:
         sudo npm install hiredis
         this will use an interpreter written in C to access redis instead of one written in javascript...
         (bootnote: rememeber to rebuild this _every_time_ you upgrade node, it can lead to issues otherwise)

   it is highly recommended that you use one of the above store methods rather than memory, as it is known to leak.

2) register your application here: https://dev.twitter.com/apps
3) register a gmail account, and go here for a url shortener key: https://code.google.com/apis/console
4) register for an imgur api key here: http://imgur.com/register/api_anon
5) configure the remaineder config.json
   a few things you should know:
   on dev.twitter.com:
     set application type to "browser", and use "http://<host>:<port>/<oauth_callback>" as the callback url.
     set access to read + write + direct messages
   if you cannot directly set the host and port, leave the host as "", and the port as 0.
   be sure to change the storage_secret to something other than blank - it is a salt for sessions!
