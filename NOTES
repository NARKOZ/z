   do not, under any circumstances, do any of the following until these notices are removed:
     1) run this server in a production environment, or allow more than a single user to connect (localhost + you!)
     2) enable the sitestream code, it is untested right now and is mostly considered "scaffolding" pseudocode to doc
        what is described on the page.

1) install libs:

   leaf requirements (install in order!):
     sudo npm install connect
     sudo npm install connect-gzip
     sudo npm install express
     sudo npm install jade
     sudo npm install oauth
     sudo npm install socket.io
     sudo npm install socket.io-sessions

     storage_type = memory:
       sudo npm install nstore
     you can safely ignore all redis_* vars if you leave this set to memory. note that leaving sessions set to memory
     is a bad practice in node because stuff like connect's memory middleware (used by express) is known to leak.

     storage_type = redis:
       sudo npm install connect-redis

     bootnote: if you are using dotcloud and socket.io 0.7.x seems to be broken, i have included backwards compatibilty
     between whatever the latest version of socket.io is versus 0.6.18. if you seem to be having this problem, install
     socket.io through npm at 0.7 (to pull in the libs), then set socket_io_version to 0.6 in config.json. should work!

2) register your application here: https://dev.twitter.com/apps
3) register a gmail account, and go here for a url shortener key: https://code.google.com/apis/console
4) register for an imgur api key here: http://imgur.com/register/api_anon
5) configure the remaineder config.json
   a few things you should know:
   on dev.twitter.com:
     set application type to "browser", and use "http://<host>:<port>/<oauth_callback>" as the callback url.
     set access to read + write + direct messages
   if you cannot directly set the host and port, leave the host as "", and the port as 0.
