1) register your application here: https://dev.twitter.com/apps
2) register for a klout api key here (you need to register a seperate account first): http://developer.klout.com/apps/mykeys
3) muting users is now possible with one "funny" exception: you can not do it directly from within the client itself.
   instead, i decided to use the events system available in userstreams, specifically the "block" and "unblock" events.
   so with that said, you will need to go to the official site and block said user you want to mute, and vice versa
   to unmute. pretty simple in the end, just not so obvious at first.
