1) register your application here: https://dev.twitter.com/apps
   be sure to set the application type to "browser", use "http://127.0.0.1:8080/oauth/callback" as the callback url.
   copy the oauth key and secret into config.json (and change anything you would like in there)...
   be sure to change the storage_secret to something other than blank - it is a salt for sessions!
2) register for a klout api key here: http://developer.klout.com/apps/mykeys
3) register for an imgur api key here: http://imgur.com/register/api_anon
4) muting users is now possible with one "funny" exception: you can not do it directly from within the client itself.
   instead, i decided to use the events system available in userstreams, specifically the "block" and "unblock" events.
   so with that said, you will need to go to the official site and block said user you want to mute, and vice versa
   to unmute. pretty simple in the end, just not so obvious at first. also, if you can access the "localstorage" within
   your browser, you can mess with this and client + hashtag muting (seperate each entry with a space).
