1) install libs:

   leaf requirements (install in order!):
     sudo npm install connect
     sudo npm install connect-gzip
     sudo npm install express
     sudo npm install jade
     sudo npm install jsonreq
     sudo npm install oauth
     sudo npm install socket.io
     sudo npm install socket.io-sessions

   optional:

     mongo support:
       sudo npm install connect-mongo
       set storage_type to "mongo" in config.json

     redis support:
       sudo npm install connect-redis
       set storage_type to "redis" in config.json

2) configure config.json

3) register your application here: https://dev.twitter.com/apps
   be sure to set the application type to "browser", use "http://127.0.0.1:8080/oauth/callback" as the callback url.
   copy the oauth key and secret into config.json (and change anything you would like in there)...
   be sure to change the storage_secret to something other than blank - it is a salt for sessions!
4) register for a klout api key here: http://developer.klout.com/apps/mykeys
5) register for an imgur api key here: http://imgur.com/register/api_anon
