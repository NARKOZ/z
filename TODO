1) fix some general but minor cloning issues that seem to arise with the increasing complexity of displaying tweets
2) update the menu with retweeted info (so you can undo it)
3) fix the time updater in opera, seems broken
4) improve the window itself since it closes after every click, if not completely replace the engine used (livepipe)
