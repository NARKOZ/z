1) stop userstream when client disconnects
2) pull the new id of what is retweeted in (so it can be undone if necessary)
3) more overall sanity, i have quite a bit in already but i am addicted to putting ifs / else ifs / elses / switches, so deal with it
4) further simplification of clientside javascript for faster execution
5) documentation of some sort maybe?
6) a way to internally hold new tweets as they come in when "paused", and  spit those out when unpaused
7) deleting tweets is untested, its a rare occasion when i need to do that
8) possibly a govern of some sort when it spits out too many tweets (eg it slows each outputted tweet down to one per second)
9) reset the userstream every...1000-2000 or so tweets / hour, whichever comes first
10) ability to mute individual users, clients (or the source param from the api, eg "Tumblr"), mentions, etc
11) this one will require more than one sentence to explain because im polarized at both ends for implementing either:
    - idea #1: implement a "hovercard" style tooltip or something when you hover over a users avatar
    - idea #2: implement an entire page to display a specific users tweets and info when clicking on their avatar
12) extend the notifications support beyond google chrome / chromium (although you can do this in firefox using: http://code.google.com/p/ff-html5notifications/)
13) fix mention cloning from the home timeline into the mentions timeline so the buttons work in either timeline
