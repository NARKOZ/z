1) stop userstream when client disconnects
2) deleting tweets and dms works but dms need a little bit more work in order to visually show it was deleted (like deleting your own tweets)
3) possibly a govern of some sort when it spits out too many tweets (eg it slows each outputted tweet down to one per second)
4) reset the userstream every...1000-2000 or so tweets / hour, whichever comes first
5) ability to mute individual users, clients (or the source param from the api, eg "Tumblr"), mentions, etc
6) extend the notifications support beyond google chrome / chromium (although you can do this in firefox using: http://code.google.com/p/ff-html5notifications/)
