1) stop userstream when client disconnects
2) pull the new id of what is retweeted in (so it can be undone if necessary)
3) more overall sanity, i have quite a bit in already but i am addicted to putting ifs / else ifs / elses / switches, so deal with it
4) further simplification of clientside javascript for faster execution
5) documentation of some sort maybe?
6) a way to internally hold new tweets as they come in when "paused", and  spit those out when unpaused
7) deleting tweets is untested, its a rare occasion when i need to do that
8) possibly a govern of some sort when it spits out too many tweets (eg it slows each outputted tweet down to one per second)
9) fix the reply thing, everything works except the specific id replied to
10) reset the userstream every...1000-2000 or so tweets / hour, whichever comes first
