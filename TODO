1) stop userstream when client disconnects
2) further simplification of clientside javascript for faster execution
3) documentation of some sort maybe?
4) deleting tweets and dms works but dms need a little bit more work in order to visually show it was deleted (like deleting your own tweets)
5) possibly a govern of some sort when it spits out too many tweets (eg it slows each outputted tweet down to one per second)
6) reset the userstream every...1000-2000 or so tweets / hour, whichever comes first
7) ability to mute individual users, clients (or the source param from the api, eg "Tumblr"), mentions, etc
8) this one will require more than one sentence to explain because im polarized at both ends for implementing either:
    - idea #1: implement a "hovercard" style tooltip or something when you hover over a users avatar
    - idea #2: implement an entire page to display a specific users tweets and info when clicking on their avatar
9) extend the notifications support beyond google chrome / chromium (although you can do this in firefox using: http://code.google.com/p/ff-html5notifications/)
10) fix mention cloning from the home timeline into the mentions timeline so the buttons work in either timeline
