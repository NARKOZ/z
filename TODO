1) fix some general but minor cloning issues that seem to arise with the increasing complexity of displaying tweets
2) opera bugs:
   a) fix the context menu
   b) work with some of the general stupid things opera tends to do despite there being a general unspoken rule of
      "how to do certain things a very certain way", kind of like how you see logos on the left side of a hat.
3) site streams support - when this is implemented, it will be possible to host multiple users without getting a
   nice ban / blacklist from the entire twitter api )for doing multiple userstreams from one server)
