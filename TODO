1) fix some general but minor cloning issues that seem to arise with the increasing complexity of displaying tweets
2) opera bugs:
   a) fix the context menu
   b) work with some of the general stupid things opera tends to do despite there being a general unspoken rule of
      "how to do certain things a very certain way", kind of like how you see logos on the left side of a hat.
3) site streams support - when this is implemented, it will be possible to host multiple users without getting a
   nice ban / blacklist from the entire twitter api )for doing multiple userstreams from one server)
4) convert the userinfo tooltip thing into its own modal window (eg the settings window) & display more info
   ^--in addition to this, possibly link to another hidden tab (like the threaded conversation tab) that will show
   the last 20 or so (whatever the startup_count int is) tweets there for convenience.
5) generally improve the following items:
     - url shortening mechanism (serverside = great, clientside coult possibly use a seperate button, more triggers
       and sanity between resetting, etc things of this general nature?)
     - context menu mechanism with more sanity, do more testing with undoing retweets (a rare occasion for me)
     - repeat the above line, except with favorites (though this seems more stable now)
     - finish off any remaining translation stuff and improve it as much as possible so it makes sense
       - as a sidenote for this, feel free to maintain any translations for now, and send a pull request with them
         once i have all of the general translating itself done and have a "spec", if you will
6) decide whether to remove the current related_results request code since its not very stable and im in no rush
   to decypher an undocumented api call (i found it looking around in the regular clientside javascript they send
   with every request) or to just remove it from the git repo itself and wait for the code to become documented,
   then recommit it.
7) decide to either do like tweetdeck and have a "new tweet" button which opens a modal window with a textarea.
   the upside and addition to funcitonality is submitting multilined tweets (linebreaks), or to leave it as it is.
   im siding with the latter since i wrote it that way for a reason. right now there is code commented out that
   provide a working textarea and resizer but it is not within a modal window (back this code up?)
8) decide whether to do list support:
     - lists are not available in realtime
