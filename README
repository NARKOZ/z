about:

mostly just a client im writing in my spare time, nothing really that special here.
it is meant to be ran with only a single user (eg localhost, NOT the internet) at a time at the moment.

you should use http://127.0.0.1:8080/oauth/callback as your callback url. configure in z,js.
an oauth token and secret has been included which points to everything correctly when ran locally.

it is licensed under the new bsd license, and is partially based on "designo" (search for it on here),
and a small section of a free template from arcsin.se

rquirements:

npm install connect
npm install connect-gzip
npm install express
npm install jade
npm install oauth
npm install socket.io
npm install socket.io-sessions

note:

upon the client disconnecting from the socket, there needs to be a way to stop the userstream properly.
until this is done, make sure that after you disconnect, you stop the entire server before running in
your browser again. sorry for this inconviencence!

another note:

keep the above mentioned modules up to date! there is a good chance that if something was updated in
one of those modules that breaks current code, it will be fixed and committed soon (and break the
client for you if you dont stay up to date). to do that, just run: npm update
