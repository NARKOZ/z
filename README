about:

this is a "two part" twitter client i am writing in my spare time. by "two part" i mean:

  2) clientside - "stable" but still in progress and under testing
   - interprets and displays all raw (json) api data
   - updates (eg, relative time) and prunes this data accordingly

  1) serverside - stable
   - handle and proxy all oauth requests, particularly the userstream

license:

the code as a whole is is licensed under the freebsd license, and is partially based on 
kazuyukitanimura/designo, the streaming code from jdub/node-twitter, and a small section
of a free template from arcsin.se.
