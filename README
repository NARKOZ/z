about:

mostly just a client im writing in my spare time, nothing really that special here.
it is meant to be ran with only a single user (eg localhost, NOT the internet) at a time at the moment.

it is licensed under the new bsd / freebsd styled / simplified bsd license, and is partially based on 
kazuyukitanimura/designo, the streaming code from jdub/node-twitter, and a small section of a free template
from arcsin.se.

serverside notes:

the serverside part of the z engine is very stable at this point

clientside notes:

the clientside part of the z engine is mostly stable across the four major browsers, with no testing
done on IE x.x at this point.
