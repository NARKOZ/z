about:

mostly just a client im writing in my spare time, nothing really that special here.
it is meant to be ran with only a single user (eg localhost, NOT the internet) at a time at the moment.

you should use http://127.0.0.1:8080/oauth/callback as your callback url. configure in config.json.

it is licensed under the new bsd / freebsd styled / simplified bsd license, and is partially based on 
"designo" (search for it on here), the streaming code from jdub/node-twitter, and a small section of a
free template from arcsin.se.

requirements:

npm install connect
npm install connect-gzip
npm install express
npm install jade
npm install jsonreq
npm install oauth
npm install socket.io
npm install socket.io-sessions

optional:

npm install connect-redis (use redis to handle sessions, remember to set storage_type to "redis")
