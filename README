about:

mostly just a client im writing in my spare time, nothing really that special here.
it is meant to be ran with only a single user (eg localhost, NOT the internet) at a time at the moment.

you should use http://127.0.0.1:8080/oauth/callback as your callback url. configure in z,js.

it is licensed under the new bsd license, and is partially based on "designo" (search for it on here).

rquirements:

npm install connect
npm install express
npm install jade
npm install oauth
npm install socket.io

optional:

npm install connect-gzip
