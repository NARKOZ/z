about:

this is a "two part" twitter client i am writing in my spare time. by "two part" i mean:

  1) clientside - stable but still in progress and under testing
   - interprets and displays all raw (json) api data
   - updates (eg, relative time) and prunes this data accordingly

  2) serverside - stable on userstreams and very stable on proxied requests
   - handle and proxy all oauth requests, particularly the userstream

the code as a whole is is licensed under the freebsd license.

some contained code is based on http://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/designo, the streaming
code from http://github.com/jdub/node-twitter, and a free template from arcsin.se.
